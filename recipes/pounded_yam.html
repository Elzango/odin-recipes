        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pounded Yam is a staple in many West African homes, but it is not usually eaten by itself, 
            it is often paired with many delicious African soups, and stews like Egusi soup. If you are new to this food, Iâ€™ll explain. 
            Pounded is quite similar to mashed potatoes but it has a more doughy consistency.
