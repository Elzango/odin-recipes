    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Egusi is a traditional one-pot soup that combines blended melon seed, pepper, leafy vegetables, and meat. It is nutty, spicy, and tasty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Egusi is a west African staple soup rich in fat, protein, and essential nutrients. It is particularly common in Nigeria because of its delicious match with pounded yam. The melon seed, which is the main ingredient, is derived from the melon plant in the same family as squash and gourds.

    <p>
        It is an exotic hearty food that will satisfy your taste buds. It is a staple in most West African homes, and it is an uncomplicated one-pot meal that is often accompanied by swallows like Fresh garri(Eba), Amala, Semovita, Pounded yam. Some hardcore like I am will even serve over Rice.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two (2) cups of Egusi</li>
        <li>3/4 cup palm oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup crayfish</li>
        <li>1 shrimp seasoning cube</li>
        <li>2 pounds meats and fish</li>
        <li>1/2 cup onion-chopped</li>
        <li>1 habanero (or scotch bonnet) pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 1 cup chopped greens (you could use bitterleaf for authentic taste or subtitute with spinach or kale)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil the meats and fish:</strong></li>
        <p>Preferably do this the day before so that cooking is easier the next day. Start by boiling the tougher meats then add the less tough ones. Add salt halfway through the cooking process (about a teaspoon of salt). Reserve the stock of the meat. Also, if using stockfish, be sure to soak it for some hours first and rinse thoroughly before cooking (cook it separately from the other meats/fish and discard of the stock). Stockfish has a very pungent smell so if you aren't used to it you might be shocked at how much it smells. But the taste is amazing in Egusi Soup.</p>
        <li><strong>Grind the egusi:</strong></li>
        <p>Grind the egusi using the small cup of a blender, coffee grinder or whatever grinding machine you have on hand. Be sure to remove any bad seeds from the egusi before grinding.</p>
        <li>Place palm oil in a pot and heat up on high for about 3 minutes (do not bleach). Add the onions to the palm oil and saute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground egusi to the palm oil and let it cook in it, while you stir from time to time until the egusi shrinks and starts sticking to the bottom of the pot. About 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon of crayfish and stir then add the cooked meats and their stock. Add the remaining crayfish, crayfish seasoning cube, habanero or scotch bonnet pepper then add water if needed according to desired thickness. Stir well and taste to ensure that seasoning is perfect. Let all the ingredients simmer together for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the greens and let them cook in for about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat - your egusi soup is ready!</li>
    </ol>
